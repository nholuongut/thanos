## Overview

Thanos is a set of components that can be composed into a highly available
metric system with unlimited storage capacity. It can be added seamlessly on
top of existing Prometheus deployments and leverages the Prometheus 2.0
storage format to cost-efficiently store historical metric data in any object
storage while retaining fast query latencies. Additionally, it provides
a global query view across all Prometheus installations and can merge
data from Prometheus HA pairs on the fly.
